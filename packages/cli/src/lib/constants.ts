Elevating the daily base level of these three skills directly leads to the optimization of human happiness in five fundamental domains: Minimize Suffering (Relief), Maximize Fulfillment (Fulfillment), Understand Yourself (Insight), Act Skillfully (Mastery), and Serve From Love (Service). The call for secular and science-informed mindful movement has never been so important as we are living in a century where human behaviour and decisions are determining the faith of the planet and humanity itself. Your funding will help to value the time and effort of the coaches, the costs of running online sessions and likely even in-person courses based in Prague in the coming future.",

Concentrated chaos which can be found in Bordel leads the inexperienced visitor on a tour trough entropy of knowledge, doubts and excitement. Chaos and entropy is what we experiment with in Bordel. When chaos comes to live in our little place in the basement of legendary Paralelní Polis, the whole building is feeling the good and chaotic vibrations of Bordel. As it happens with a mess and chaos, Bordel also appeared without planning or warnings. It always oscillated on the edge of entropy and complete disorder. Paralelní Polis didn't have time to figure out whether Bordel brings the order or just another separatist movement. Being part of Polis, Bordel lives its own life but in the deepest symbiosis possible. That's why we troll Polis folks and compete in the vote for the funding. Bordel pays its fa share within Paralelní Polis and creates a lot of own content and expensive tools for community. Archival node maintained by Bordel is also one of the projects you support by voting for us. TLDR, vote for us and come have a party in Bordel!",
