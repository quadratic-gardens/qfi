              credits. For example, if you would like to cast 5 votes for Project A, that will cost 25 voice credits.

              You <b>cannot use more voice credits than you have</b>. Since each voter starts with 99 voice credits, a
              vote of 10 (which would cost 100 voice credits) is more than any voter can afford to pay. This means that
              at most, a single voter can give 9 votes to a single project - at a cost of 81 voice credits - and have 18
              voice credits left to vote for other projects.{" "}

              The ballot will be tallied at the end of the voting period, and the{" "}
